Slide 1:
Hi everyone, welcome! In this module, we’ll explore the essential elements of reading technical drawings — a foundational skill for any hardware or electronics engineer. You’ll learn how to interpret the title block, understand various symbols, and grasp projection views commonly used in mechanical and electronic schematics. Let’s dive into these fundamental components that bridge the gap between design and real-world execution.

Slide 2:
Let’s begin with the title block — the ‘ID card’ of any technical drawing. The title and part number help identify what the drawing represents. Revisions indicate version history, so you know if you’re using the latest design. Drafter and approver names show accountability, and dates give traceability. Don’t skip this block — it sets the stage for what you’re viewing.

Slide 3:
Symbols are the visual shorthand of engineering. For electronics, they represent everything from resistors and capacitors to connectors and ground points. Familiarize yourself with the standard IEEE or IEC symbols used in your company. Accurate interpretation is key to ensuring components are installed and connected correctly.

Slide 4:
Projection views allow you to see a 3D object in 2D space. 1st angle and 3rd angle are two main conventions — make sure to check the drawing symbol to know which one is used. These views show all sides, including hidden details and cutaway sections. Understanding these helps you visualize the part as it will appear physically.

Slide 5:
Here’s a sample title block to help connect the theory to practice. You can see all the fields we discussed earlier — from the title to revision to drafter and approver. This table helps you practice identifying what each field means, so next time you see a real drawing, you’ll feel right at home.
